	"description": "Enter, into the world of knowledge of the BLYATVERSITY, with the unique NFT exclusively linked to the book 'FU*K YOU, CRYPTO!'. This technically spectacular NFT was procedurally generated on the blockchain and is therefore truly unique. We hereby show that NFTs do not always have to be images on a server, but that NFTs can also be generated immutably on the blockchain. \nBut beware, it also has a dark side: on the chest of the middle monster you can see that we always know where you are. All kidding aside, our NFT also has a day and night cycle. Weird flex? Maybe. Cool NFT? Definitely"
